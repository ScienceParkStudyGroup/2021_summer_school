# Welcome!

 This website compiles all necessary information about the workshop contents, organisation, registration information and people involved in __the first edition of the Amsterdam Science Park Study Group Summer School__.  

This Summer School will consist in a series of two-day workshops designed to teach basics as well as more advanced topics in scientific programming. Whether you're just getting started in programming or feel already competent, this training event should help you to enhance the quality and efficiency of your research. Learning basic and domain-specific programming skills will not only improve the quality of your research findings, it will also promote a more Open Science as well as offering you new career perspectives in the long run.

# Learning tracks

## For absolute beginners
If you're an absolute beginners, we advise you to follow either the _Open Data Science with R_ or the _Python programming_ 
workshops. 
This will get you going and you will be able to import, transform and curate a dataset as well as creating plots to generate 
insights on your data.  


## RNA-seq
If you are interested in RNA sequencing analysis, please consider following:
1. The _Open Data Science with R_ workshop. 
2. Followed by the _Introduction to RNA-seq_ workshop.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```


### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *



```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```
