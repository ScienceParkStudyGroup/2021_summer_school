# Welcome!

 This website compiles all necessary information about the workshop contents, organisation, registration information and people involved in __the first edition of the Amsterdam Science Park Study Group Summer School__.  

This Summer School will consist of a series of two-day workshops designed to teach basics as well as more advanced topics in scientific programming. Whether you're just getting started in programming or feel already competent, this training event should help you to enhance the quality and efficiency of your research. Learning basic and domain-specific programming skills will not only improve the quality of your research findings, it will also promote a more Open Science as well as offering you new career perspectives in the long run.  

# Key information

## Dates

- **Week 1:** Monday 21 to Friday 25 June 2021.  
- **Week 2:** Monday 28 to Friday 2 July 2021.  

## Themes
- **Week 1:** programming in R and Python: from absolute beginner to competent practitioner.
- **Week 2,** several parallel tracks:
	- **Parallel track 1:** microbiome analysis, amplicon and shotgun metagenomics.
	- **Parallel track 2:** geospatial data in R and Google Earth Engine for geoscientists and ecologists. 
	- **Parallel track 3:** RNA-seq analysis.    

You do not have to participate in all modules but, rather you can register for one or more two-day training modules independently. 


## Costs
Free for staff from the SILS and IBED institutes (FNWI, UvA).   
Small costs (10-50E) to be determined for external participants.

# Learning tracks

## For absolute beginners
If you're an absolute beginner, we advise you to follow either the _Open Data Science with R_ or the _Python programming_ 
workshops. 
This will get you going and you will be able to import, transform and curate a dataset as well as creating plots to generate 
insights on your data.  


## RNA-seq
If you are interested in RNA sequencing analysis, please consider following:
1. The _Open Data Science with R_ workshop. 
2. Followed by the _Introduction to RNA-seq_ workshop.  


<br>

## Microbiome 
If you are interested in amplicon-based and/or shotgun sequencing for microbiome analyses, please consider the following:
1. The _Programming with Python_ workshop. 
2. Followed by the _Metabarcoding analysis using QIIME 2_ workshop. 
3. And/or followed by the _Data processing and visualization for metagenomics_ workshop. 

<br>

## Geospatial analysis
If you are interested in geospatial data, please consider the following:
1. The _Open Data Science with R_ workshop. 
2. Followed by the _Geospatial analysis in R_ workshop.
3. Followed by the _Google Earth Engine_ workshop (no R skills required for this workshop).
